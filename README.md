# Understanding Less
A basic repo to follow up what I am learning while taking a less course https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/less-is-more

## Following up the course

The repo is structured in lessons. Each lesson has its own branch, if you want to start the course from scratch fetch all branches and navigate along them.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ibandominguez/understanding-less.git
cd understanding-less
npm install
gulp # This should proccess all the less files imported in src/app.less
```
